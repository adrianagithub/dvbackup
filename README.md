# README

This is my first project with Ruby on Rails.
I developed this prototype to help people facing Domestic Violence after I took my Ruby on Rails bootcamp.

The main reason because I developed this project was thinkig about the people who are facing this kind of incidents and they feel lonely in the middle of the chaos that Domestic Violence Incidents bring to their lives. 

This version was developed with Rails 5, JavaScript, HTML, SCSS.
The gems that I used in this project are devise, bootstrap, social-share-button, rspec-rails, factory_bot_rails, faker, activeadmin, rails_controller_testing.

After my Bootcamp CTD picked this project to continue to develop in the Practicum.
